**Version:** 1.0  
**Date Published:** 2025-10-21  
**Data Collected:** September 2025   
**Sample Size:** N = 1,003  
**Geographies:** United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand
**Survey Platform:** Google Forms + Prolific  
## Description and Purpose  

The Digital Life Survey 2025 explores how people experience attention, energy, trust, and focus in an always-connected world.  
It includes 1,003 anonymised responses from participants in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.  
Respondents answered questions on screen-time habits, digital fatigue, values alignment, and levels of trust across online environments such as social media, news sites, and search platforms.  
Findings from this dataset underpin several Human Clarity Institute reports — *Values vs Noise*, *Why Can’t I Focus*, *Digital Fatigue & Energy*, *Digital Trust*, and *Coping & Wellbeing* — providing the quantitative foundation for each report’s hero statistics.

## Structure of the Dataset  

Each row represents one participant’s complete response.  
Each column corresponds to a single survey variable.  

**Variable groups include:**  
- **Demographics** – country, age group, gender identity, employment status.  
- **Digital Behaviour** – average hours online, devices used, purpose of use, multitasking frequency.  
- **Fatigue & Energy** – post-session energy levels, signs of digital tiredness, recovery activities.  
- **Trust & Information** – perceived reliability of different online environments, self-reported confidence in identifying misinformation.  
- **Values Alignment** – extent to which online actions reflect personal values, perceived conflict between values and digital habits.  
- **Wellbeing Indicators** – focus quality, motivation, satisfaction after digital sessions.  
- **Open-Ended Questions** – short free-text reflections about digital balance and clarity.

All direct identifiers present in the raw exports (e.g., PROLIFIC_PID, SESSION_ID, timestamps, IP addresses) have been removed from this public dataset.  
Columns that could enable re-identification (such as country of birth when highly specific, or detailed language variants) were generalised or deleted.  
The released CSV is fully de-identified and compliant with open-data ethical standards.  
Missing data are encoded as blank cells; explicit responses such as “Prefer not to say” are retained as text.


## Data Verification Summary  

This dataset has been manually validated against all hero statistics published in related Human Clarity Institute reports.  
Verification was performed using the HCI_Data_Verification_Log.xlsx workbook, confirming that all reported percentages and figures match the underlying survey responses within normal rounding precision.  
The verification process included random spot-checks of question coding, COUNTIF/COUNTIFS formula validation, and cross-dataset consistency checks between the Digital Life and Focus & Distraction surveys.  
All verification work was completed in October 2025 by the Human Clarity Institute research team.
